    <font size = "5">For Years I have dreamt about writing my own mystery books the way that I believed they should be written, I Have published a couple of great books like <i>The Key?</i> and <i>Where Is It?</i> they are phenomenal reads and I encourage you to check them out . As a father of two delightful young children, my writing days are now long gone, but now as a publisher for<i>Logos</i>I can extend that dream to the next generation of aspiring writers.</font>
